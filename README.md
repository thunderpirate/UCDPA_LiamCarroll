This is a Python 3 script for reviewing the Fantasy Premier League (FPL) API and other season datasets to gain insights, including adopting machine learning techniques to predict outcome of English Premier League (EPL) based on various FPL ratings and attributes.

It is found that using this FPL data, Logistic Regression and SVC classifiers provide 75% accuracy in predicting match outcome.
